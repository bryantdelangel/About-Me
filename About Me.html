<h1><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>About Bryant DelAngel:</strong></span></h1>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">One knows one&rsquo;s passion when you realize that you have spent a couple of hours and only feels like a couple of minutes. I love spending time reading about new technologies, the latest innovations, and the latest&rsquo;s trends. You can say my field of work &ldquo;requires&rdquo; me to stay up to date with any new technologies, software, or solution that can benefit the company. Yes, that is right but the only difference is that I don&rsquo;t look at it as part of my job. I actually enjoy reading, researching new technologies, software, and solutions. My Apple News algorithm even knows that hence why at any time I open the Apple News app the first thing that would most likely come up will be technology and security related <em>(WhatsApp users will lose app features until they accept new privacy policy </em>- 9TO5Mac<em>)</em>. The amazing part of my line of work is we really have to put our minds and dedication to finding solutions that would benefit our users. It can take hours, days, weeks to come up with a solution, understand the solution and teach our users how the solution works in a way that they will understand. This can be from troubleshooting hardware to implementing new software.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Technology is great and can solve many issues, but it can also be dangerous and manipulative. When many technologies are linked to one source (centralized) we are all dependent on that one source. If that one source fails, then everything tied to that source fails. On the other hand, decentralized technologies are safer since there is not a one-source infrastructure but many. This creates various fail-safes in the case that one sub source fails. Decentralized technologies are beneficial to the constant innovation in technology. Departments within companies can easily implement or create new solutions or technologies and implement them without going through so many barriers that come with implementations in a centralized environment.</span></p>

<h1><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>Octobox App for Github:</strong></span></h1>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Octobox meets Github&rsquo;s requirements for listing.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Octobox is open-source.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Please beware that any open source has a high chance for hackers to exploit and attack vulnerabilities, this is given that the source code is open and can easily be read for vulnerabilities. You are at a higher risk for account hijacking and potentially access to personal information that can be stolen.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Your personal and/or companies&rsquo; intellectual property could be at risk with any open-source app including Octobox.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">It is highly recommended to use a close source app that can have a higher chance of protection against attacks or vulnerabilities exploits.</span></p>

<h1><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>Production Website is down? Now what&hellip;</strong></span></h1>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">If a production website is down the first order of business is to visit the website from a separate device and make sure it is not an isolated issue with the user&rsquo;s device.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We need to ensure what the main issue is.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We ping the domain to make sure the server is up and reachable, we can find that either the server crashed and/or programming error. If not successful, we would run a traceroute to pinpoint where the issue could be.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We also need to verify the domain has not expired. (Who.is a great tool to find out the status of the domain)</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">If the server has crashed completely we will need to fire up the server and figure out what happened.</span></p>
